# Whatsapp-ChatBot
Whatsapp Chatbot using machine learning, Papaya Conversational Data Set

<P> A chatbot is made using selenium and machine learning to reply with automatic responses while the user is offline.
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li> Selenium is used to fetch and send the data using whatsapp web.</li>
    <li> Machine learning using <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/" target="_blank">papaya dataset</a> is used to process the messages from other users and give them a proper response. </li>
   
  </ul>
  <br>
 
  <b>NOTE:</b>  Code to process the messages (Machine learning part) is not added right now. I am working on optimization and other improvements. It will be added soon.
